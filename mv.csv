A000,Advent I,First Sunday of Advent,,-21,0,sun1,purple,St. Mary Major,"The Roman Missal today begins the liturgical cycle. The Incarnation is the true central point which divides the course of the ages. By the period of preparation called Advent, the ages before Christ and leading us to His birth are recalled; following the feast of Christmas the great events in the life of Christ and the ages that lead toward the final judgment are kept in mind. The Missal, therefore, is logical and corresponds closely to this lofty concept of history, by which the Incarnation is made the true central event in the world's drama. The early Christians began their liturgical cycle with the festival of Christmas; the present arrangement came into use towards the middle of the fifth century. (Fr. Lasance Missal, 1630-31).
